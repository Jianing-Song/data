The space cannot be partitioned into more than one and at most countably infinitely many nonempty closed sets.

Equivalently, $X$ is connected and cannot be written as a countably infinite union of pairwise disjoint nonempty closed sets.

Defined in Chapter 5, Section 4, Definition 5.15 of {{doi:10.1201/9781315274089}}.
