Not being a disjoint union of countably many (including finitely many) and more than one nonempty closed subsets: If $X=\displaystyle\bigcup_{n\in\omega} C_n$ with $(C_n)_{n\in\omega}$ being a countable disjoint family of closed subsets, then one of $C_n$ is equal to $X$ and the others are empty.

Eqivalently, every countinuous map from $X$ to {S15} is constant: Since every singleton in {S15} is closed, a partition of $X$ by closed sets is equivalent to a continuous map from $X$ to {S15}.

Defined in Chapter 5, Section 4, Definition 5.15 of {{doi:10.1201/9781315274089}}.
