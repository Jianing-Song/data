The order-convex subsets (which include open intervals) of a {P37} {P133} are {P37}. Indeed, for $a < b$ in a {P37} {P133}, pick a path $\gamma$ in the space such that $\gamma(0)=a$ and $\gamma(1)=b$, and define $t_0=\sup\\{t\in[0,1]:\gamma(t)\le a\\}$, $t_1=\inf\\{t\in[0,1]:\gamma(t)\ge b\\}$. By the intermediate value theorem we must have $\gamma(t_0)=a$ and $\gamma(t_1)=b$, then by definition $\gamma(t)\in[a,b]$ for $t\in[t_0,t_1]$, so we have found a path joining $a$ and $b$ in $[a,b]$.
